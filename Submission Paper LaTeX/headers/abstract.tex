We investigate the polynomial-time approximability of the dynamic version of Min-Sum Set Cover ($\DSSC$), a natural and intriguing generalization of the classical List Update problem. In $\DSSC$, we maintain a sequence of permutations $(\pi^0, \pi^1, \ldots, \pi^T)$ on $n$ elements, based on a sequence of requests $\cR = (R^1, \ldots, R^T)$. We aim to minimize the total cost of updating $\pi^{t-1}$ to $\pi^{t}$, quantified by the Kendall tau distance $\dkt(\pi^{t-1}, \pi^t)$, plus the total cost of covering each request $R^t$ with the current permutation $\pi^t$, quantified by the position of the first element of $R^t$ in $\pi^t$. 

Using a reduction from Set Cover, we show that $\DSSC$ does not admit an $O(1)$-approximation, unless $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$, and that any $o(\log n)$ (resp. $o(r)$) approximation to $\DSSC$ implies a sublogarithmic (resp. $o(r)$) approximation to Set Cover (resp. where each element appears at most $r$ times). Our main technical contribution is to show that $\DSSC$ can be approximated in polynomial-time within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ in general instances, by randomized rounding, and within a factor of $O(r^2)$, if all requests have cardinality at most $r$, by deterministic rounding.
