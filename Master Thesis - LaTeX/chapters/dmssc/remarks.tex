\section{Concluding Remarks}
In this work we examine the polynomial-time approximability of Multistage Min-Sum Set Cover. We present $\Omega(\log n)$ and $\Omega(r)$ inapproximability results for general and $r$-bounded request sequences, while we respectively provide $O(\log^2 n)$ and $O(r^2)$ polynomial-time approximation algorithms. Closing this gap is an interesting question that our work leaves open. Another interesting research direction concerns the competitive ratio in the online version of Dynamic Min-Sum Set Cover. 
\cite{FLPS20} provides an $\Omega(r)$ lower bound and a $\Theta\left(r^{3/2}\sqrt{n}\right)$-competitive online algorithm for $r$-bounded sequences. Designing online algorithms for a relaxation of the problem (such as the $\mathrm{Fractional}-\mathrm{MTF}$) and using the rounding schemes that this work suggests may be a fruitful approach towards closing this gap.
